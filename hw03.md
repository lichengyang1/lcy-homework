## Part 2
**Method of complements**

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. 

**Byte**

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. 

**Integer (computer science)**

In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer. 

**Floating point**
<br><br>
In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.

1.证明：设二进制正数x.
<br><br>
Negative[x]=$2^k$-x=($2^k$-1-x)+1

其中， $2^k$-1 = (2-1)( $2^{n-1}$ + $2^{n-2}$ +...+2+1)= $2^{n-1}$ +...+1

故每位为1，其减去x即为求反
得二进制X的负数由X每位求反加1得到

2.x= $(761)_8$

1.x=$(11100001) _2$ = $(e1) _ {16}$ 
 y=$(1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 0001)_ 2$ = $(ffffffe1)_{16}$ 
<br><br><br><br>
2.证明:设二进制数x.
当x为正数时,x=(0$X_7$$X_6$$X_5$ ... $X_1$),y=(0000000...$X_1$)=x
当x为负数时,x=(1$X_7$$X_6$$X_5$...$X_1$)

$\because$  $${(x)}{2} = \sum{i=1}^{k}d_{i}2^{i-1}$$

$\because$ Two's complement

$$N(x) = 2^{k} - x$$,

$$N'(x) = 2^{m} - x$$ where $$m > k$$

$\therefore$ $$N'(x) = 2^{m} - x = (2^{m} - 2^{k}) + 2^{k} - x = (2^{m}-1) - (2^{k}-1) + N(x)$$

$\because$ $$2^{m}-1 = (2-1)\sum_{i=1}^{m}2^{i-1}$$, that is m bits 1. So the same, $$(2^{k}-1)$$ is k bits 1

$\therefore$ If N(x) is a negative binary integer, the most-significant bit can be repeated in all the extra bits

$\blacksquare$

NaN:
In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.
