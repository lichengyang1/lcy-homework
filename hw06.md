**CPU**:

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.


**RAM**：

Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.

**ROM**：

Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges. 

**Bus**：

 a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

**Parallel Computing**:

 Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.

 云计算:

云计算是一种基于互联网的计算方式，通过这种方式，共享的软硬件资源和信息可以按需求提供给计算机各种终端和其他设备。 

云是网络、互联网的一种比喻说法

①"3”代表第三代双倍数据率同步动态随机存取存储器

1333即标示它的工作频率是1333MHz

②不能。主板支持的最大频率是1333MHz，DDR3-1600的内存只会调用1333MHz。

③能。内存双通道，就是指的两条内存条能在同时间里并行运行。两个相同的内存，增加了内存的带宽，CPU和内存之间的数据交互量增大，能提升性能。

④16GB=$2^{34}$B=$log_2$$2^{34}$ =34
